I&#8217;ve got an old 17&#8243; Macbook Pro from late 2008 that&#8217;s still kicking. It&#8217;s served me a lot of good years filled with studying, scripting, exams, etc. and I&#8217;ve never had a problem with it. I mostly keep it around for testing OSX related things, and as a backup. Last year I replaced the aging 512GB HDD with a 256GB SSD which did wonders to speed it up. This year the battery has finally went on it, so I ebay&#8217;d a [replacement][1] ($25) from [plus_86][2]. They&#8217;re a 3rd party battery replacement shop that ships out of Quebec. I also decided to up the RAM from 2GB to 4GB. Looking back on it, I&#8217;m wondering how I ever managed just with 2GB. I had a couple VMs running on this at one time! I ordered a 4GB kit from [memoryfast][3], they&#8217;ve got a rebate program where I can ship them my old RAM for a small credit to my order, not bad!

I had a heck of a time replacing the memory. I&#8217;d read this before, but Apple likes to use Loctite 247 on their screws to keep them from vibrating loose. Not a bad idea, until you try to remove them for an upgrade&#8230; I bent a phillips 00 screwdriver trying to get the last one out, then ended up stripping it. I read that Apple techs have a power tool that does this, and I&#8217;m not surprised. After unsucessfully trying a soldering iron and a glue gun to heat up the screw in hopes of loosening the loctite, I ended up drilling out the last screw. I&#8217;m not sure yet if I should be upset that I had to do that, or happy that those design decisions have given me an 8 year old laptop that&#8217;s still kicking. Oh well. At least I didn&#8217;t have to pay an Apple genius to do it for me.

If you don&#8217;t have a precision screwdriver kit already, you should get one. They&#8217;re handy for laptop, mobile phone, and other small electronic repairs. I use a basic flat head and phillips kit, with some spare phillips that are slightly smaller in size. For most jobs, you&#8217;ll need the phillips triple zero, double zero, and zero sizes.

Removing the battery at the rear is easy, but as I mentioned that one screw was a pain. The picture quality isn&#8217;t the greatest, but you can see the blue loctite on the screws.

Removing the memory is easy-peasey, just push outwards on the metal clasps, and remove the DIMMs at 25 degree angle. This is a shot of them seated:

And finally, after inserting the new DIMMs, a happy laptop.

Hopefully this laptop lasts another few years. It&#8217;s safe to say it certainly doesn&#8217;t owe me anything ðŸ™‚
