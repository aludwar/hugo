Something Engineering has been working hard on over the past couple of years is connecting Red Hat&#8217;s wealth of internal knowledge with items and issues customers face in the real world everyday. Born out of this effort was Red Hat Insights, a predictive analytics engine that analyzes, assesses, and builds automation to remediate issues found in customer environments. I think this is a really valueable tool to take advantage of, not only because it&#8217;s no-cost to customers, but its like having a sysadmin audit your environment 24&#215;7, and building automation to fix the things it finds. It&#8217;s a really easy way to get started with Ansible automation without having to build or write the automation yourself.

Check out [how this works in a demo I recorded][1]. Let me know what you think!
