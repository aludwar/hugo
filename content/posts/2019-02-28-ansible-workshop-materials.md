Recently we had one of the largest and most interesting meetups I think the Calgary market has seen in quite a while. We were able to run an Ansible Workshop, which is a mix of presentation and hands-on lab content. What makes these workshops different (and a reason people love them) is we get to teach a concept, then implement it in a lab. Teach a concept, do a lab. So attendees get to do immediate application of the knowledge they just gained, and they walk away with real skills they could use in their day-to-day work right away. Attendence and feedback for this event were excellent:

The second great thing about these workshops is that they&#8217;re 100% open source. The Red Hat Ansible team publishes all the training slides, the exercises, examples, and AWS lab provisioners in a git repo for easy consumption and repetition. There&#8217;s nothing stopping someone from spinning up one of these workshops internally for themselves for their own practice and training. The [main git repo is located here][2] for those who are interested.

There are also [Networking specific workshops][3], and a [Windows workshop][4] available as well. I&#8217;m hoping to be able to bring these to Western Canada in the short term future.

Thanks to all who attended and helped run the event!
