I&#8217;m a little late on this post, but last week we had an excellent presentation on OpenStack installers. Specifically, TripleO. Chris J from Red Hat gave us a good outline of TripleO&#8217;s capabilities, and kept it pretty upstream. For the presentation slide deck, [see here][1]. The group tries to keep it as vendor neutral as possible which is nice. There were a lot of questions and feedback, this is probably a topic worth going into in a little more detail, or perhaps doing some hackfest demo&#8217;ing!

There&#8217;s been quite an uptick in our [local OpenStack meetup group][3] lately, it&#8217;s been fun to see and get involved with. Both this group, as well as our [Red Hat User Group][4] has brought in some high profile and very talented open source folks who&#8217;ve presented and shared their knowledge with us.

The OpenStack meetup groups across Canada have come together and created a Slack channel for easier communication and sharing among its members. If you&#8217;re interested in joining the channel, drop a comment or send me an email for an invite!
