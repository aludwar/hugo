Okay, I give. I found this tool way too cool not to blog about it. Definitely the most interesting post by Lifehacker in a while. Someone has developed a tool that [creates a heat map of your Google location history][1]. Download your data from Google in JSON format, and upload to the tool. Now I&#8217;m yearning for another scuba diving trip to Hawaii.
