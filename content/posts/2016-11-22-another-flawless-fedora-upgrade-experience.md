Today is [Fedora 25 official release][1] day. There are a few [notable new additions for this release][2], I&#8217;m looking forward to trying out Wayland the most. I just wanted to pay a quick kudos to the Fedora team for another flawless [upgrade][3] experience. Job well done friends! My upgrade time was less than 30 minutes. As I play with the new features in the next coming days, I&#8217;ll throw some more content up here for review.

Happy Fedora&#8217;ing!
