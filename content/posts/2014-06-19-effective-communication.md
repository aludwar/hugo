As an IT professional, one of the most important job skills you can possess may not necessarily be technical.  Excuse me, what? How is that so? We&#8217;re IT people! If we&#8217;re masters of anything, it&#8217;s the technical bits in the trade!

Typical studies show that we spend 70-80% of our day communicating with others, and 40% of our day interacting with others&#8217; writing ([source][1], [source][2]).  That&#8217;s a big chunk of time!  If you think about it though, it makes quite a bit of sense.  Have you ever got stuck reading a giant email chain in order to get caught up on an issue?  Have you ever come across a co-worker or colleague who you&#8217;ve been listening to drone on and on and couldn&#8217;t help but think to yourself, &#8220;just get to the point already!&#8221;.  I think we&#8217;ve all been there.

Effective communication can be vital to not just efficiency and productivity, but also success.  Think about these situations for example:

  * Have you ever asked a question and received an answer that didn&#8217;t fully address what you asked?
  * Did you get too much information and were forced to sift through it all to find what you needed?
  * Have you asked something of someone else only to have them do something completely different?
  * Have you ever read a poorly written email?  Received an invite or request that was missing important details?
  * Sent an email but missed an attachment?
  * Read an email that had improper tone?  Maybe one with a little too much &#8220;emotion&#8221;?

When I sit back and think about it, I come across all of these things on a regular basis.  Then, I find myself trying hard not to be &#8220;one of these people&#8221;, but I&#8217;m sure I&#8217;ve done it to others as well.  Having recently completed an effective business writing course, the most prominent thing I learned was that the writer or communicator is responsible for the reader&#8217;s comprehension.  Not the other way around.

If I present an idea to you, it is my job as the communicator to help **YOU** understand **ME**.  You can&#8217;t read my mind, you don&#8217;t know my thoughts.  The only thing you can do is keep reading, or listening.  If I include information that&#8217;s not relevant to my point, not relevant to my audience, or don&#8217;t structure it in a way that lends to your comprehension then I&#8217;ve started to lose your attention and very likely my message.  This is especially important in the IT field as we face many communication challenges:

  * Technical acronyms and terms
  * Non-technical folk mixed in with technical folk
  * Introverts and extroverts
  * Written, non-verbal, and verbal communication mediums

No wonder people get a blank look on their face when we try to explain how DNS works, or why data centre standards are important!

This is why I say one of the biggest assets an IT person can have is being able to effectively communicate (and sometimes translate!) the technical details to other co-workers and staff members.  IT is arcane and obscure enough as it is.  Helping others see it like we do will help us establish rapport with our non-technical colleagues, and enable understanding of how their IT can bring them business value.
